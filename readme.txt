This is a Ruby On Rails project I developed for honors credit in my software engineering course.  
The site is desinged to allow users to upload images, add descriptive tags, favorite images and reccomend to users images based on the tags of their favorited images.
The key files in the project are:
	-app/controllers/rec_controller: the algorithm used to provide reccommendations
	-app/controllers/images_controller.rb: The controller for posting, searching, and viewing images as well as editing their tags.
	-db/migrate:  This folder contains the information for all models used
